,,
Sensor speed: The seismic sensor takes measurements 10 to 100 times every second. This is a moderate speed to keep things manageable.,,
,,
Noise filtering: The processor cleans up the sensor data using a basic “smoothing” technique (like softening a rough picture). This method needs about 10 to 20 steps to work well.,,
,,
"Work done per measurement: For each sensor reading, the processor does around 20 simple math steps to reduce noise.",,
,,
Data size: Each sensor reading is a small amount of data—about the size of 2 to 4 letters in a text message.,,
,,
"Machine learning model: The AI model used to analyze this data is quite small, about the size of a short story (20,000 letters).",,
,,
"AI analysis frequency: The AI looks at the cleaned data about once every second, making it a steady but not rushed process.",,
,,
"AI work amount: Each time the AI runs its analysis, it does a few thousand math calculations—enough to recognize basic patterns without heavy computing.",,
,,
"Processor load: When the sensor reading, noise filtering, AI analysis, and other tasks all run together, the processor works at about 20% to 35% most of the time, with occasional peaks up to about half its capacity. This means there’s still plenty of room to handle other jobs.",,
,,
"Processor speed: The processor can handle up to 2 instructions at once every cycle, but on average, it usually processes about 1 to 1.2 instructions each cycle due to pauses or waiting for data.",,
,,
"Memory use: The processor’s internal memory is very fast and efficient—about 90% of the time, it quickly retrieves the needed data, and only occasionally needs to look somewhere slower.",,
,,
"Interrupts: The processor gets “interrupts” or signals to perform quick tasks less than 100 times every second, which helps it stay responsive without being overwhelmed.",,
